"""
This subpackage contains the modules for user-defined experiments and tests, i.e., the *run scripts*.

.. warning::
    As of v0.90.1, the run scripts are executed directly, and so Sphinx's ``autodoc`` capabilities cannot be used for the modules in this subpackage.

    All documentation for the run scripts must be created manually until a proper frontend is implemented!
